# Family Finance Tracker - Project Status

## Current Status

The Family Finance Tracker application is being developed with:
- Next.js for the frontend framework
- Firebase for authentication and database (Firestore)
- Plaid API integration for bank connections and transaction data
- Deployed on Netlify

## Recent Issues and Fixes

### Type Errors
- Fixed type error in `src/app/layout.tsx` related to the Inter font variable
- Resolved type issues with the Firebase db variable in `src/hooks/use-firebase.ts` by explicitly typing it as `Firestore | null`
- Fixed similar type issues in other files using the db variable

### Plaid Integration
- Successfully configured Plaid sandbox credentials in local development
- Set up necessary API routes for Plaid integration:
  - `/api/plaid/create-link-token`
  - `/api/plaid/exchange-public-token`
  - `/api/plaid/oauth-redirect`
  - `/api/plaid/get-transactions`

### Firebase Implementation
- Fully implemented Firebase authentication
- Set up Firestore collections for user profiles, households, transactions, etc.
- Improved SSR handling to prevent Firebase initialization errors during prerendering

## Deployment Issues

The application continues to experience deployment issues on Netlify. Potential problems may include:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are properly set in Netlify deployment settings
2. **Build Configuration**: Possible issues with Next.js build process
3. **Firebase/Plaid Integration**: Service connection issues in production environment

## Required Environment Variables

```
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Plaid API Keys
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your-plaid-client-id
PLAID_SECRET=your-plaid-secret
PLAID_ENV=sandbox
PLAID_REDIRECT_URI=https://family-finance-tracker.netlify.app/api/plaid/oauth-redirect

# SECURITY NOTE:
# Never commit actual API credentials to version control!
# Store credentials in:
# - Local development: .env.local file (add to .gitignore)
# - Production/Netlify: Use Netlify's environment variable settings
# - Get credentials from: https://dashboard.plaid.com/
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review Netlify Logs**: Analyze the deployment logs to identify specific error messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Confirm all required environment variables are correctly set in Netlify
3. **Test Build Locally**: Run `next build` locally to check for any build errors before deployment
4. **Check Firebase Rules**: Ensure Firestore security rules are properly configured for production
5. **Plaid Dashboard Configuration**: Verify the redirect URI is properly configured in the Plaid Dashboard
6. **SSR Compatibility**: Review any components that might cause issues during server-side rendering:
   - Check for `window` or browser-specific APIs usage without appropriate guards
   - Ensure Firebase initialization is properly handled in SSR context

## Testing Credentials

For testing the Plaid integration in the sandbox environment:
- Username: `user_good`
- Password: `pass_good`
- Or any username with password `pass_good`

## For Handoff
